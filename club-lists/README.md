# Harvard Club Lists

We've compiled a full list of all the student organizations at Harvard, including Independent Student Organizations, Club Sports, and PBHA-associated organizations. Each file contains different combinations of these different kinds of organizations.

- `osl-clubs-17s.txt`: just Independent Student Organizations (ISOs), as of Spring 2017.
- `osl-clubs-clubsports-17s.txt`: ISOs and club sports, as of Spring 2017.
- `osl-clubs-pbha-17s.txt`: ISOs and PBHA clubs, as of Spring 2017.
- `osl-clubsports-17s.txt`: Just club sports, as of Spring 2017.
- `osl-master-organizations-list-17s.txt`:

## Generating lists

You can use most of the data sources as they are. However, **ignore** the ISO titled "Club Sports" from the [official ISOs list](http://osl.fas.harvard.edu/student-organizations). That isn't useful, and when combined with the actual club sports dataset, causes problems.

## About

This dataset was compiled by the Harvard Undergraduate Council, our undergraduate student body government, and [Neel Mehta](https://github.com/hathix), the Finance Committee Chair.
