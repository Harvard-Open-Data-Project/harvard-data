## Contributing

To upload a dataset (or group of related datasets), just make a pull request. Organize all your datasets into a single folder. In the folder, also include a file `README.md` that explains:

- Your name
- The name of the dataset(s)
- Background about the dataset(s) -- Where did this data come from? Why is it useful?
- If it isn't immediately obvious, what each field in the dataset(s) stands for. For instance, if you're uploading a CSV, you can describe what each column represents.
- And anything else that might be useful for future researchers!

As an example, see `club-lists`.
