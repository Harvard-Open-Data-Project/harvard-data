# Harvard Open Datasets

Found a cool, open dataset about Harvard that doesn't have a home? You can host it here!

## List of datasets available here

> **NOTE:** this list only mentions datasets hosted on this GitHub repositry. If you'd like to submit an open dataset to the [HODP catalog](http://harvard-open-data-project.github.io/), please share it with us [on our website](http://harvard-open-data-project.github.io/). This repo is only for hosting dataset files.

- `club-lists`: a full list of all undergraduate student organizations and club sports at Harvard.

## Contributing

> **NOTE:** do *NOT* just provide links to datasets that already exist online. This repository is *solely* to provide a convenient home for datasets that don't currently have an online home. Again, don't link to other datasets, just upload files that aren't already online.

To upload a dataset (or group of related datasets), just make a pull request. Organize all your datasets into a single folder. In the folder, also include a file `README.md` that explains:

- Your name
- The name of the dataset(s)
- Background about the dataset(s) -- Where did this data come from? Why is it useful?
- If it isn't immediately obvious, what each field in the dataset(s) stands for. For instance, if you're uploading a CSV, you can describe what each column represents.
- And anything else that might be useful for future researchers!

As an example, see `club-lists`.
